about_me_description: "Throughout my academic journey, completing coursework and crafting my ePortfolio has been instrumental in refining my strengths and molding my professional aspirations. This self-assessment aims to delve into how these experiences have equipped me to thrive in the computer science field, focusing on key areas such as collaborating in a team environment, communicating effectively, mastering data structures and algorithms, excelling in software engineering and database management, and embracing security principles.  Collaboration in a team environment  Midway through the computer science program at SNHU, I was surprised to find that many of the courses did not focus on coding, but on the way that software development teams functioned.  These were not my favorite courses because I really wanted to code, but I did learn alot about the structure, process, and collaborative nature that teams employ.  I am confident that I can seamlessly collaborate with members of diverse teams.  Effective Communication to Stakeholders  Another focus of the courses that diverged from coding was on the ability to articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences.  These courses combined with my own professional experience has informed me to be wary of getting too deep into the weeds in highly technical issues.  Doing so might cause confusion for the stakeholder which is counter productive.  Data Structures and Algorithms Mastery  My programs curriculum emphasized data structures and algorithms, equipping me with the fundamental skills to design efficient solutions to intricate problems. Through coursework assignments and personal coding projects, I have consistently tackled algorithmic challenges, such as optimizing sorting algorithms and devising intricate data structures. These experiences have undoubtedly fortified my problem-solving capabilities.  Software Engineering and Database Expertise  The programs focus on software engineering and database management provided me with a robust foundation for designing, developing, and maintaining scalable applications. From creating a functional web application to integrating a database schema, my coursework demanded meticulous attention to detail and adherence to industry best practices. These experiences have instilled a sense of craftsmanship in my approach to software development.  Embracing Security Principles  In an age of increasing cyber threats, my coursework prompted me to grasp the significance of security in software design. Ive implemented encryption algorithms and learned to fortify applications against potential vulnerabilities. Beyond coursework, I have extended this knowledge by participating in cybersecurity competitions, enhancing my practical understanding of safeguarding sensitive information.I specialize in Modeling, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning. My work involves data collection through API calls and Database Queries. I have a robust background in Advanced Mathematics and enjoy creating elaborate algorithms."
