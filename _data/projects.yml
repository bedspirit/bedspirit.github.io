- name: Code Review
  descr: "The story of the GUBR is the story of my journey through the Computer Science Program at SNHU.  I wrote the original for my job after taking my first C++ course.  It has gone through a few iterations over the years.  The latest development will blend parts of the oldest one with parts of the newest one.  This will maximize performance and interactivity.  This is a video code review of the GUBR1 and GUBR2."

- name: Software Design and Engineering
  descr: "The Original GUBR was a command line program designed to filter data that represents inventory items.  This is a revision of that program that gives it a Window Forms GUI using CLI/C++ .NET Framework.  This transformation isn't necessarily remarkable, but it facilitates the merger of the data structure from the original GUBR with the GUBR2."

- name: Algorithm and Data Structures
  descr: "This is the merger of the data structure that gave the GUBR superior performance with the user friendliness of the GUBR2.  The result is an 80% increase in performance.  This project displays the impact of a superior data structure."

- name: Database
  descr: "This project represents a fresh step forward for the GUBR.  The GUBR and GUBR2 read files created by a mainframe.  This version of the GUBR is able to retrieve data from a database eliminating the need to run a mainframe job.  This project displays the convenience of utilizing SQL queries for data collection."
