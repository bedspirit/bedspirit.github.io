<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Collaboration in a Team Environment</h2>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">The Computer Science Program at SNHU features a surprising number of courses that focused on the way that software development teams function.  I took multiple courses on SCRUM, LEAN, and DSDM.  These courses featured projects which had to be completed collaboratively.  I feel well prepared to work in a collaborative environment.</p>
<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Effective Communication to Stakeholders</h2>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">The software developent courses also taught how to articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences.  I think it's particularly important to avoid miscommunications with shareholders. Their understanding is required for them to give the necessary feedback to create a product that meets their business goals. </p>
<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Data Structures and Algorithms Mastery</h2>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down"> The program gave me a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures.  I try to make every script or app I write to perform as quickly as possible.  I have spent a great deal of time studying the fastest algorithms and most appropriate data structures to achieve the best performance.</p>
<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Software Engineering and Database Expertise</h2>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">The programs focus on software engineering and database management provided me with a robust foundation for designing, developing, and maintaining scalable applications. From creating a functional web application to integrating a database schema, my coursework demanded meticulous attention to detail and adherence to industry best practices. These experiences have instilled a sense of craftsmanship in my approach to software development.</p>
<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Embracing Security Principles</h2>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">In an age of increasing cyber threats, my coursework prompted me to grasp the significance of security in software design. Ive implemented encryption algorithms and learned to fortify applications against potential vulnerabilities. Beyond coursework, I have extended this knowledge by participating in cybersecurity competitions, enhancing my practical understanding of safeguarding sensitive information.</p>
