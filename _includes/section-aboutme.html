<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Collaboration in a Team Environment</h2>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">Midway through the computer science program at SNHU, I was surprised to find that many of the courses did not focus on coding, but on the way that software development teams functioned. These were not my favorite courses because I really wanted to code, but I did learn alot about the structure, process, and collaborative nature that teams employ. These courses prepared me to work in a collaborative environment.</p>
<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Effective Communication to Stakeholders</h2>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">Another focus of the courses that diverged from coding was on the ability to articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences.  These courses combined with my own professional experience has informed me to be wary of getting too deep into the weeds in highly technical issues.  Doing so might cause confusion for the stakeholder.</p>
<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Data Structures and Algorithms Mastery</h2>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">My programs curriculum emphasized data structures and algorithms, equipping me with the fundamental skills to design efficient solutions to intricate problems. Through coursework assignments and personal coding projects, I have consistently tackled algorithmic challenges, such as optimizing sorting algorithms and devising intricate data structures. These experiences have undoubtedly fortified my problem-solving capabilities.</p>
<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Software Engineering and Database Expertise</h2>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">The programs focus on software engineering and database management provided me with a robust foundation for designing, developing, and maintaining scalable applications. From creating a functional web application to integrating a database schema, my coursework demanded meticulous attention to detail and adherence to industry best practices. These experiences have instilled a sense of craftsmanship in my approach to software development.</p>
<h2 style = "text-align:center;">Embracing Security Principles</h2>
<p class="description" data-aos="fade-down">In an age of increasing cyber threats, my coursework prompted me to grasp the significance of security in software design. Ive implemented encryption algorithms and learned to fortify applications against potential vulnerabilities. Beyond coursework, I have extended this knowledge by participating in cybersecurity competitions, enhancing my practical understanding of safeguarding sensitive information.</p>
